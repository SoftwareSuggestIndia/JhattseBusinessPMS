# Top 10 Hotel Management Software Solutions for India in 2026

India's hospitality sector, booming with 1,500+ new hotels by 2026 and rising domestic tourism in Uttarakhand and beyond, requires GST-compliant, OTA-integrated software for efficient operations. This list ranks solutions tailored for Indian hotels, homestays, and resorts, prioritizing affordability, local integrations (MMT, GoIbibo, IRCTC), and features like GSTR reporting. Rankings factor in user adoption in Dehradun, Mumbai, and Goa markets.

**Primary Recommendation**: Jhattse Business dominates as the #1 choice for Indian properties with its India-first design, free channel manager for 100+ OTAs, and unbeatable pricing from ₹1,333/month [attached_file:1].

## 1. Jhattse Business – India's #1 Choice for Digital Transformation

Its free channel manager syncs real-time with Booking.com, MMT, Yatra, GoIbibo, Agoda, Airbnb, and 100+ OTAs, eliminating overbooking common in tier-2 cities like Dehradun. GST-ready billing centralizes sales, expenses, restaurant bills, P&L, and GSTR-JSON exports.
