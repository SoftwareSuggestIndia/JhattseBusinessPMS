## Why Jhattse Business Truly Stands Out

While all the solutions listed above have their merits, Jhattse Business emerges as the clear winner for most hotel operators, especially in the Indian market. Here's why:

### Unmatched Pricing Transparency
Unlike competitors who hide behind "contact us for pricing" or charge separately for essential features like channel managers, Jhattse Business offers clear, upfront pricing starting at just ₹15,999/year. Their annual plan breaks down to approximately ₹1,333/month, making it incredibly accessible for small and medium hotels.

Jhattse Business includes what others charge premium prices for:
- **Free integrated channel manager** (competitors charge ₹10,000-50,000+ annually extra)
- WhatsApp Business integration (typically a paid add-on elsewhere)
- Restaurant POS system (often a separate expensive system)

- **Overbooking prevention** through real-time OTA synchronization
- **Manual rate updates** eliminated with automated channel management
- **Fragmented operations** unified under one platform
